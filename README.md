1. Initialize necessary variables:
    - questions: List of questions
    - answers: List of corresponding answers
    - current_index: Index to keep track of the current question
    - timer_thread: Thread object for managing the countdown timer
    - time_limit: Duration for each question's timer

2. Define functions:
    a. display_question(index):
        - Display the question at the given index
        - Clear the answer entry field
        - Start the countdown timer

    b. start_timer():
        - Initialize remaining_time to time_limit
        - Define a countdown function:
            - Decrement remaining_time by 1 every second
            - Update the time label to show remaining_time
            - If remaining_time reaches 0, call time_up()
        - Start a new thread to run the countdown function

    c. time_up():
        - Display a message indicating that time is up for the current question
        - Proceed to the next question

    d. check_answer():
        - If the timer_thread is alive, join it to ensure completion
        - Get the user's answer from the entry field
        - Compare the user's answer with the correct answer for the current question
        - Display a message indicating whether the answer is correct or wrong
        - Proceed to the next question

    e. next_question():
        - Increment current_index to move to the next question
        - If there are more questions, call display_question() for the next question
        - If all questions have been answered, display a completion message

    f. exit_quiz():
        - If the timer_thread is alive, join it to ensure completion
        - Close the Tkinter application

3. Create a Tkinter GUI:
    - Create labels for displaying the question and the remaining time
    - Create an entry field for user input
    - Create a submit button to check the answer
    - Configure the GUI layout

4. Display the first question:
    - Call display_question(0) to show the first question

5. Enter the Tkinter main event loop:
    - Start listening for user interactions
    - Update the GUI based on user actions
