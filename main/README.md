Quiz applicatin

Overview
This is a Python-based interactive quiz application designed to test users' general knowledge. The application presents a series of questions and allows users to input their answers. It provides immediate feedback on whether the answers are correct or not.
Features
- Randomized questions: The questions are randomized each time the quiz is started.
- Timer: A timer is provided for each question, giving users a limited time to answer.
- Interactive interface: Users can input their answers directly into the GUI.
