This python scripts creates a simple general knowledge quiz using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface(GUI) and threading for managing time-limited questions. Here is a breakdown of its components and functionalities:
Question and Answer: There are two separate lists in the quiz that contain a list of questions and their answer. To give the test a random feel, those questions and answers will be rotated.
Displaying Question: The display question function updates the question label with the current question from the shuffled list and starts a timer thread to limit the time for answering each question.
Answer Validation: The check_answer function compares the userâ€™s input to a correct response when submitting an answer. If the answer is correct, it will display a message of success; otherwise you will be shown an incorrect reply.
Moving to the next question: After answering a question or when the time limit is reached, the next_question function moves to the next question if available or displays a completion message if all questions have been answered.
Setup of the graphical user interface: The Tkinter library is used to create the graphical user interface. It consists of a window with labels for questions, an entry widget for users to input answers, moving to the next question and exiting the quiz.
Exit functionality: The exit_quiz function closes the Tkinter window and ends the quiz.
Main loop: The main event loop is started by the root.mainloop() statement, which allows the GUI to be interactive.
This script enables users to test their general knowledge by answering a series of questions within a time limit in an interactive quiz. The use of a thread makes it possible to display all questions for an indefinite period, thereby improving the dynamics of the question. Moreover, the shuffling of questions adds a degree of variability of every game and makes it interesting for contestants. In general, this script can be used to create custom quizzes using Tkinter and python.
